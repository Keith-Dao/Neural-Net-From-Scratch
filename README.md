# Neural Net From Scratch

This project is an implementation of a simple neural network with two hidden layers, made specifically to classify digits in the MNIST dataset.

## Goals:

- Create the neural network from scratch, i.e. without the use of deep learning libraries (PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.)
- Be able to train the model
- Be implemented in Python and C++
- Be able to save and load the model weights
